ULTIMATUM GAME APPLICATION - INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROFESSOR
===============================================================================

Dear Professor,

Thank you for reviewing our Ultimatum Game application for ECON 4310. This 
application implements a multi-round, multiplayer ultimatum game designed to 
study behavioral assimilation in social preferences among immigrant populations.

===============================================================================
GITHUB REPOSITORY
===============================================================================

Full source code, documentation, and setup instructions are available at:
https://github.com/MJLee02/ultimatum-game-app

The repository includes:
- Complete application source code
- Database schema and migration scripts
- Setup guide for replication
- Deployment instructions
- MIT License for open source use

===============================================================================
HOW TO ACCESS THE GAME
===============================================================================

[LIVE DEPLOYMENT LINK WILL BE HERE - check GitHub for latest deployment URL]

Or run locally by following the setup instructions in SETUP_GUIDE.md

===============================================================================
HOW THE GAME WORKS
===============================================================================

GAME STRUCTURE:
1. Players join a multiplayer lobby automatically upon opening the app
2. When at least 2 players are present (must be even number), any player can 
   start the game
3. Players complete 10 rounds of the ultimatum game
4. Each player is randomly assigned as proposer in 5 rounds and responder in 
   5 rounds
5. Players are randomly matched with different opponents each round
6. After 10 rounds, players complete a demographic survey focused on migration 
   history
7. Results show total points earned and final dollar winnings

GAMEPLAY MECHANICS:
- Proposers split 40 points between themselves and a responder
- Responders can accept or reject the offer
- If accepted: both players receive their respective shares
- If rejected: both players receive 0 points for that round
- Players do NOT see who they are matched with (anonymous)
- Players do NOT see results from previous rounds during gameplay
- Total points ÷ 10 = final dollar earnings

===============================================================================
HOW TO TEST THE GAME (Multiplayer Experience)
===============================================================================

To experience the full multiplayer game, you will need at least 2 devices or 
browser tabs:

OPTION 1: Single Device Testing
1. Open the game URL in 2 or more browser tabs
2. Each tab represents a different player
3. Wait for all players to join the lobby
4. Click "Start Game" when you have an even number of players (2, 4, 6, etc.)
5. Switch between tabs to play as different players
6. Complete all 10 rounds in each tab
7. Fill out demographic survey in each tab

OPTION 2: Multiple Device Testing
1. Share the game URL with colleagues or use multiple devices
2. Each device represents a different player
3. All players will see each other join the lobby in real-time
4. Any player can start the game when there's an even number
5. Play through the game simultaneously on different devices

===============================================================================
DEMOGRAPHIC DATA COLLECTED
===============================================================================

After gameplay, the app collects the following demographic information:
- Date of Birth
- Country of Birth
- Current Country of Residence
- Generation Status (0 = first generation immigrant, 1 = second generation, etc.)
- Countries Lived In (with start and end dates)

This data enables analysis of behavioral patterns based on migration history 
and generational status.

===============================================================================
DATA ACCESS
===============================================================================

All game data is stored in a Supabase database. To access the data:

1. Log into the Supabase project (credentials provided separately if needed)
2. Navigate to Table Editor
3. View the following tables:
   - games: All game sessions
   - game_players: Player participation
   - player_roles: Role assignments per round
   - rounds: Proposals, decisions, and payouts
   - demographics: Participant demographic information
4. Export data as CSV or JSON for analysis

Sample SQL queries are available in the repository documentation.

KEY FEATURES FOR RESEARCH VALIDITY
===============================================================================

✓ Random role assignment to prevent order effects
✓ Anonymous matching to reduce reputation effects
✓ Multiple rounds to capture behavioral patterns
✓ Real-time multiplayer synchronization
✓ Migration history collection for assimilation analysis
✓ Data isolation between independent game sessions

===============================================================================
TECHNICAL DETAILS
===============================================================================

- Built with: React Native + Expo (cross-platform web/mobile)
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL + real-time subscriptions)
- Deployed on: Vercel (free hosting)
- License: MIT (open source)
